## About:

- A simple method of generating a spoof website that offers fake discount codes for problematic companies.
- When the “coupons” are attempted to be redeemed, the website redirects to a list of all the exploitative behavior of the problematic companies instead.
- It’s designed to directly target and inform the patrons of said companies and to deter them from giving money towards detrimental activities.
